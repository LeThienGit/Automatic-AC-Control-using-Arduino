Tired of continuously switching your AC ON and OFF just to maintain an ambient and comfortable temperature in your room.Let your AC do it on its own.

In this project we are going to make our AC switch ON and OFF automatically according to the temperature in the room.

What we will be doing is that we are going to connect a DHT11 sensor to Arduino which senses the temperature of the room and as the temperature reaches a particular value then Arduino will send an ON or OFF signal to the AC through an IR LED and the AC will switch ON and OFF accordingly.
